                                                <p>In PK2, children are beginning to recognize their own emotions but may
                                                    lack the words to fully express them. We emphasize creating a safe and
                                                    nurturing environment where each child feels valued and supported. Our
                                                    goal is to assist them in navigating various emotions like frustration,
                                                    anger, fear, and excitement. While they may find sharing and taking
                                                    turns challenging, they are starting to learn these fundamental social
                                                    interactions. With gentle guidance and engaging activities, we help them
                                                    develop patience and impulse control, fostering their growth in managing
                                                    emotions and building social skills.

                                                <p>In PK2, childrenâ€™s motor skills are becoming more refined as they engage
                                                    in various balancing exercises. They can walk, run, and even race with
                                                    greater stability and improved coordination. Their climbing abilities
                                                    improve, allowing them to tackle playground equipment with increasing
                                                    ease. Fine motor skills advance as children use chalk, crayons, or
                                                    markers with a stronger grasp, allowing for more purposeful scribbling
                                                    and early attempts at drawing shapes or lines. They also enjoy
                                                    activities like playdoh, stacking blocks, manipulating large puzzle
                                                    pieces, and using a spoon to feed themselves, showing improved hand-eye
                                                    coordination and dexterity.

                                                <p>In PK2, our focus is on expanding vocabulary and understanding basic
                                                    literacy concepts. Students are introduced to the alphabet through song
                                                    and play. They interact with books by turning pages and identifying
                                                    familiar pictures, letters, or sounds. Activities include reading books
                                                    aloud with increasing complexity, engaging in simple storytelling with
                                                    picture prompts, recognizing their name, tracing letters, and playing
                                                    simple letter-matching games. Interactive songs and rhymes are also
                                                    incorporated to enhance language development and phonemic awareness.
                                                    Children have the opportunity to naturally explore pre-writing by using
                                                    a variety of writing tools such as crayons, markers, and paint.

                                                <p>In PK2, mathematical activities focus on counting and sorting skills as
                                                    well as shape recognition. Teachers incorporate counting games, songs,
                                                    and group activities to help children practice counting objects and
                                                    understand the concepts of "more" and "less" by comparison. Measurement
                                                    is introduced as children practice comparing two objects by size and
                                                    length. They gradually advance to ordering a small set of objects.
                                                    Students also practice categorizing objects by attributes such as color,
                                                    shape, or size. They will also become aware of simple patterns in their
                                                    daily lives and progress to creating very basic repeating patterns using
                                                    beads or blocks. As the year progresses, students should be able to
                                                    count to 10 orally, count up to 5 objects successfully, with proper one
                                                    to one correspondence, and even recognize a few numerals. Additionally,
                                                    their understanding of ordinal numbers, such as "first" and "second," is
                                                    reinforced through daily routines and simple activities such as lining
                                                    up toys or taking turns.
