                                The ClubAnglais approach is based on research and best practice in immersion education. In English immersion programs children do not merely learn about the English language in the classroom.

                    <p>This starts with excellence in teaching English to children in North Africa, ages eighteen months
                        through fourteen years. We do this through a variety of programs: " For children ages 6-14, we offer
                        after-school clubs where we teach English through fun, engaging activities such as sports, games,
                        music, art, and drama. We also offer English camps for children ages 6-14, which provide an
                        opportunity for them to be immersed in English seven hours per day. " For children ages 18 months
                        through 5 years, we offer English clubs in the evenings. We also offer an English language immersion
                        preschool, which provides a comprehensive preschool education, taught entirely in English, seven
                        hours per day, five days per week. " Our mission is not simply to transmit information, but to
                        engage students in the learning process in a variety of positive, encouraging ways. We aspire to
                        connect personally with our students to provide a wholistic, nurturing, and safe learning
                        environment. We pay careful attention to our studentsâ€™ attitudes and motivations, as well as their
                        cognitive development. We believe that as we do these things, we will have an opportunity to make a
                        lasting impact on the children we serve. In order to accomplish this we pay careful attention to
                        four particular aspects of our pedagogical model: </p>

                    <ul class="requirements-list">
                        <li>
                            <i class='bx bx-check'></i>
                            The affective domain
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i class='bx bx-check'></i>
                            The immersion approach to language learning
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i class='bx bx-check'></i>
                            Developmental aspects of language learning

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i class='bx bx-check'></i>
                            Differentiation
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In the same way that we aspire to transform the lives of our students in positive ways, we also hope
                        to help transform the communities we serve. We seek to build relationships with the families of our
                        students so we can include them in the learning process and ensure that we are doing our best to
                        meet their needs. We are committed to investing in our local staff and helping them develop
                        professionally. We also hope that our work will, in some small way, contribute to the economic
                        development of the communities we serve as we address the growing importance of English in the
                        global market place. Beyond that, we seek to build bridges of understanding between cultures as our
                        native-English-speaking staff integrate into society in ways that show respect and appreciation for
                        their host culture. " Finally, our mission is to help contribute to the ongoing science of education
                        so that we might play a small role in improving learning outcomes for children everywhere. As we
                        innovate and continuously improve our pedagogical model we hope that what we learn will be useful to
                        other educators; allowing us, in some small way, to help transform lives even beyond our own
                        classrooms and communities.</p>
