                                                <p>In PK4 we support and encourage the development of the children in the
                                                    areas of self-regulation, positive relationships and group
                                                    participation. At the beginning of the year we seek to create a
                                                    welcoming environment for every child. In order to create a safe and fun
                                                    place for everyone we clearly communicate the classroom routines and
                                                    expectations, which most children at this age are able to grasp quickly
                                                    and grow in following throughout the year.
                                                    From the beginning of the year we foster self-confidence by giving the
                                                    students responsibility to care for their own wellbeing and also as part
                                                    of the class.
                                                    It is natural at this age for children to begin developing special
                                                    relationships with two to three children. We encourage and support this
                                                    as well as helping them find ways to include everyone.
                                                    Inevitably social problems arise. We are always available to help the
                                                    children and give them the tools they need to be able to negotiate and
                                                    compromise to find a solution.

                                                <br>

                                                <p>In this area we actively work on supporting the development of the
                                                    children’s various physical skills, such as traveling (how they get
                                                    around), balancing, gross-motor and fine-motor.
                                                    Both in the classroom and outside we incorporate a lot of movement
                                                    throughout the day which strengthens and challenges the children.
                                                    At this age children have already developed fairly capable coordination
                                                    and balance and therefore we are able to introduce them to more complex
                                                    activities, such as obstacle courses, races and choreographed dances.
                                                    Balls and other gross-motor toys are a fun and vital part of continuing
                                                    to grow both physically and socially.
                                                    In PK4 we continue to build on the fine-motor skills the children have
                                                    already developed. We help correct and practice appropriate hold of
                                                    drawing and writing tools and practice cutting carefully with scissors.
                                                    By the end of the year the children will begin to use a three-point
                                                    finger grip and efficient hand placement when writing and drawing. They
                                                    will also likely be able to cut along a line with accuracy and cut out a
                                                    circle as well as other shapes.

                                                <p>This is a vital area in the development of a child as well as for
                                                    language learning, therefore we place a strong emphasis on pre-literacy.
                                                    Throughout the day there is time to interact with books quietly
                                                    individually, in twos and as a group with the teacher and later students
                                                    lead the read-aloud time. As they develop their ability to ask and
                                                    answer questions about a text and also recount details of a story, the
                                                    PK4 students may also be assigned as reading buddies with the younger
                                                    class.
                                                    Most of the students will begin PK4 with a basic understanding of rhyme
                                                    and alliteration. We will continue to build on this knowledge and help
                                                    develop their phonological awareness to where they are able to begin
                                                    sounding out one-syllable words.
                                                    Throughout the year we will continue to introduce the alphabet both
                                                    lower-case and upper-case, with the goal of the children being able to
                                                    identify and name 11-20 letters when presented in random order by the
                                                    end of the year. They will also be able to begin producing at least one
                                                    correct sound for each letter in the alphabet, and come up with words
                                                    that begin with a given letter.
                                                    In PK4 the children are at a place developmentally where they are able
                                                    to trace letters more carefully and begin writing them on their own. In
                                                    this way, they will begin to learn to write their name accurately. As
                                                    they grow in their desire to communicate messages in written form, they
                                                    will continue to use drawing, dictation and early invented spelling to
                                                    accomplish this.

                                                <p>This area of development and learning encompasses number concepts,
                                                    spatial relationships, shapes, measurement and patterns.
                                                    At the beginning of the year we will review and solidify the children’s
                                                    knowledge of the numerals 1-10 and build on their counting skills. As
                                                    the year progresses the children will learn to make sets of objects and
                                                    describe the parts which have more, less or the same. By the end of the
                                                    year they will be introduced to addition and subtraction word problems
                                                    of whole numbers within 10 using a variety of strategies.
                                                    In PK4 students will have a basic understanding of positional words
                                                    indicating location, direction and distance. By the end of the year they
                                                    may begin to make and use simple sketches, models, or pictorial maps to
                                                    locate objects. They will continue to learn about 2 and 3-dimensional
                                                    shapes and be able to describe these in their own words.
                                                    For measurement the children will begin to learn how to use some
                                                    standard measuring tools as well as relating time to daily routines and
                                                    schedule. By the end of the year they may begin to create simple graphs
                                                    using simple comparison and ordinal terms to describe their finding.
                                                    As 4 to 5 year olds, children in PK4 will learn how to extend and create
                                                    simple repeating patterns and by the end of the year begin to recognize,
                                                    create and explain more complex repeating and simple growing patterns.
