                                                <p>In PK3 we support and encourage the development of the children in the
                                                    areas of self-regulation, positive relationships and group
                                                    participation. At the beginning of the year we seek to create a
                                                    welcoming environment for every child. In order to create a safe and fun
                                                    place for everyone we clearly communicate the classroom routines and
                                                    expectations and help the children grow in their ability to manage these
                                                    as the year progresses.
                                                    In time, we help each child to take on more and more responsibility for
                                                    their own well-being and to grow in their independence. This fosters
                                                    self-confidence while maintaining an attitude of looking out for the
                                                    well-being of others.
                                                    Throughout the year, we encourage children to participate in activities
                                                    with others, playing together and also accomplishing tasks in groups of
                                                    two or more. When problems arise we are available to help the students
                                                    by offering suggestions but eventually encouraging them to grow in their
                                                    ability to work out social problems alone.

                                                <br>

                                                <p>In this area we actively work on supporting the development of the
                                                    childrenâ€™s various physical skills, such as traveling (how they get
                                                    around), balancing, gross-motor and fine-motor.
                                                    Both in the classroom and outside we incorporate a lot of movement
                                                    throughout the day which strengthens and challenges the children. We
                                                    will not push someone to try something they are not ready to do, but
                                                    provide gentle and supportive opportunities. We incorporate balls and
                                                    hoops, tunnels, climbing walls, dancing and running throughout the day.
                                                    For the fine-motor development we continue to incorporate hand
                                                    strengthening activities to prepare the children to successfully hold
                                                    writing tools. We use a variety of pre-writing activities and
                                                    pre-cutting activities slowly helping them in developmentally
                                                    appropriate ways to hold scissors and writing tools. By the end of the
                                                    year students should be able to hold drawing and writing tools by using
                                                    a three-point grip even though they may hold them too close to one end.
                                                    They will also have progressed in their scissor skills, being able to
                                                    cut along a straight line with slight deviation.

                                        <div class="tabs_item">
                                            <div class="class-desc-content">
                                                <br>

                                                <p>This is a vital area in the development of a child as well as for
                                                    language learning, therefore we place a strong emphasis on pre-literacy.
                                                    Every day there are opportunities for the children to look at books and
                                                    also for group read-aloud times. By the end of the year children will
                                                    know some features of a book (author, illustrator, setting, character,
                                                    etc)
                                                    As the year progresses we engage the children more and more in retelling
                                                    the stories that we read together, encouraging them to contribute to the
                                                    conversation with specific language from the book. When we are reading
                                                    non-fiction books, the children will begin to be able to recount details
                                                    using pictures and props as prompts.
                                                    For phonological awareness, we continue to work on learning rhyming and
                                                    alliteration through songs and poems. We also begin to make the children
                                                    aware that sentences are made up of individual words and eventually that
                                                    words are made up of syllables.
                                                    As children enter PK3 they should already have some awareness of the
                                                    letters in their name. We continue to build on this and by the end of
                                                    the year, as we introduce the alphabet, the students should recognize as
                                                    many as 10 letters and be able to identify the sounds of some of them.
                                                    As children continue to develop in their ability to hold writing tools,
                                                    they also grow in their desire to communicate through drawing, writing
                                                    and dictating. We incorporate pre-writing in our program and so provide
                                                    the children the opportunity to grow. By the end of the year, most of
                                                    them will write mock letters or letter like forms and begin to write
                                                    letter strings
                                                </p>
                                            </div>
                                        </div>

                                        <div class="tabs_item">
                                            <div class="class-desc-content">
                                                <br>
                                                <p>This area of development and learning encompasses number concepts,
                                                    spatial relationships, shapes, measurement and patterns.
                                                    At the beginning of the year most children verbally count to 10;
                                                    counting up to five objects accurately. They are also able to recognize
                                                    and name a few numerals. As we continue to work on counting in playful
                                                    ways, by the end of the year they will likely be able to verbally count
                                                    to 20 and know what number comes next. They will be able to combine and
                                                    separate up to five objects and describe the parts as well as identify
                                                    numerals 1-10 by name and connect each to counted objects.
                                                    When children come to PK3 most of them already are able to follow simple
                                                    directions related to proximity (beside, between, next to) throughout
                                                    the year we add such concepts as location,
                                                    direction and distance. We also build on their basic knowledge of shapes
                                                    and begin introducing three-dimensional shapes as well as presenting
                                                    two-dimensional shapes in new orientations.
                                                    As we work on measurement the children will grow from making simple
                                                    comparisons of two objects to comparing and ordering small sets of
                                                    objects according to size, length, weight, area or volume. They will
