                            <p>
                                The ClubAnglais approach is based on research and best practice in immersion education. In English immersion programs children do not merely learn about the English language in the classroom.
                            </p>
                        </div> -->

                        </div>
                        <h4>ENGAGED</h4>
                        <p>We believe that children simply learn better when they are fully engaged, highly motivated, and
                            having fun.
                        </p>

                        <h4>PASSION FOR KIDS</h4>
                        <p>At ClubAnglais, we have a passion for kids. We start working with kids as early as 18 months and
                            we work with them until age 14, and sometimes beyond.
                            We have a strong sense that we are called to working with kids. That is our area of expertise.
                            That is our wheelhouse. We understand that by working with kids, we have an opportunity to make
                            a lasting impact on the community around us.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h4>EXCELLENCE</h4>
                        <p>At ClubAnglais we focus exclusively on teaching English to children. That's all we do, and so we
                            strive to be the very best at it. </p>

                        </div>
                        <h4>INNOVATION</h4>
                        <p>Because our approach to teaching English is so unique, we have built our curriculum from the
                            ground up to make sure everything we do is consistent with our fun, engaging approach to
                            teaching children.
                        </p>

                            <span class="bg-5">05</span>
                        </div>
                        <h4>GROWTH</h4>
                        <p>When the initial group of investors decided to launch ClubAnglais
                            in April 2014, we realized that ClubAnglais has the potential to impact not just one
                            neighborhood, but many.
                            The growing demand for English language instruction in North Africa, along with a variety of
                            characteristics about ClubAnglais (i.e. its licensing regime, capital requirements, facility
                            requirements, etc.), result in the potential for growth.
                            Someday we hope that ClubAnglais will positively impact communities all across North Africa.
