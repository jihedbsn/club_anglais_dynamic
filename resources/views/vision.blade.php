                        <p>Indeed, we hope that these children will someday go on to transform their communities in
                            extraordinary ways. " Our vision starts with children, but it does not end there. Our hope is
                            that our work with children will ripple out to families as we come alongside parents to help
                            them realize their dreams for their children. We hope that this influence will in turn ripple
                            out to the communities where we work as we build bridges of understanding between cultures. As
                            we hire staff from within the community, our vision is to help them realize their full potential
                            as we invest in them and help them develop professionally. Finally, we hope that someday our
                            influence might ripple out to entire nations as we help them compete in the global marketplace.
                            " We also have a vision to contribute to the profession of teaching. This starts as we nurture
                            our passion for children and dedicate ourselves to doing what is best for each child in the long
                            run. Our vision is to pass on what we are learning to our local staff and help them develop
                            professionally so they can then take the best elements of our model and apply them to their own
                            careers, even after they leave ClubAnglais. We even hope that someday our hard work and
                            innovation will prove useful to the global community of educators. We hope that we can somehow
                            contribute toward the development of best practice in education, especially in the areas of: the
                            affective domain, a developmental approach to learning, immersion education, and
                            differentiation. " Finally, we have a vision for our investors. We hope that someday they will
                            see that their investment is making a lasting impact on communities across North Africa. We hope
                            that they will find tremendous satisfaction and lasting fulfillment in knowing that their
                            investment is being leveraged for good to help transform lives.</p>
