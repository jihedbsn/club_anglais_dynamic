                                                <p>In PK1, we understand that for many children, this may be their first
                                                    experience away from their families, and we are committed to supporting
                                                    them through this transition. At the start of the year, our focus is on
                                                    fostering a welcoming and secure classroom environment where every
                                                    student feels safe. As they observe, explore, imitate, and participate
                                                    in simple play, they begin to develop essential social skills. Our goal
                                                    is to create a nurturing and supportive setting that provides

                                                <p>In PK1, toddlers are beginning to walk steadily and explore their
                                                    environment with increasing confidence. Their gross motor skills include
                                                    walking with more balance and starting to run or walk quickly with some
                                                    instability. They can grasp small objects with their whole hand and may
                                                    start using their thumb and fingers more precisely to pick up items like
                                                    small blocks or toys. At this stage, they might also begin to show
                                                    ability in climbing, such as trying to pull themselves up, changing

                                                <p>In PK1, literacy development focuses on fostering early language skills

                                                    Children engage with picture books, where they enjoy looking at colorful
                                                    images and listening to repetitive read-aloud stories. They also enjoy
                                                    singing along to simple songs that include gestures or actions.
                                                    Classroom activities include pointing to pictures and naming objects, as
                                                    well as exploring books with tactile elements, which helps students

                                                    songs and rhymes emphasize numbers and basic counting, aiming to have
                                                    children count up to five by the end of the year. They also begin to
