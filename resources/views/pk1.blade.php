                                                <p>In PK1 we support and encourage the development of the children in the
                                                    areas of self-regulation, positive relationships and group
                                                    participation.
                                                    At the beginning of the year we are focusing on creating a welcoming
                                                    atmosphere in the classroom where the students can all feel safe. We
                                                    recognize that for many of them this is the first time they have been
                                                    away from their families and we want to support them in that adjustment.
                                                    From the beginning we make an effort to listen to each child and help
                                                    them learn how to communicate their needs and desires in a
                                                    developmentally appropriate way.
                                                    Our class is a community where we learn how to work together and care
                                                    for one another.

                                                <br>

                                                <p>In this area we actively work on supporting the development of the
                                                    childrenâ€™s various physical skills, such as traveling (how they get
                                                    around), balancing, gross-motor and fine-motor.
                                                    Both in the classroom and outside we incorporate a lot of movement
                                                    throughout the day which strengthens and challenges the children. We
                                                    will not push someone to try something they are not ready to do, but
                                                    provide gentle and supportive opportunities. We incorporate balls and
                                                    hoops, tunnels, climbing walls, dancing and running throughout the day.
                                                    For fine-motor development at this age we focus on strengthening the
                                                    hand muscles through many playful activities, such as using play-do and
                                                    squeezing or pinching things.

                                                <p>This is a vital area in the development of a child as well as for
                                                    language learning, therefore we place a strong emphasis on pre-literacy.
                                                    Every day there are opportunities for the children to look at books and
                                                    also for group read-aloud times. We will focus on interactive books that
                                                    engage the children. We will also use many songs and chants to begin
                                                    introducing the concept of rhyme and alliteration.
                                                    As the year progresses we will begin to help the children recognize
                                                    their name in print and begin introducing other print concepts.

                                                <p>Since PK1 is a half day preschool program, our focus is on language and
                                                    pre-literacy. However, various mathematical concepts will also be
                                                    incorporated, such as counting and shapes.
                                                    Counting is so much fun that it is easy to incorporate from the very
                                                    beginning of the year without high expectations. By the end of the year
                                                    they should be able to count up to 10 successfully.
                                                    Spatial relationships and shapes are introduced from the beginning of
                                                    the year growing to a place where the children should be able to
                                                    recognize a few basic shapes and also be able to follow basic
                                                    instructions related to position (in, on, under, up, down) and proximity
